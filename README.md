Often we are tasked with building applications which showcase multi-layer information in stacks or we can say section.
In Android world it is very helpful to show more data in concise space and user-friendly way. But for that we have to use 
basically recycler-view with headers(section).

If you'll search for section recycler-view you'll notice that majority of the results are some external libraries which i don't 
think is bad but for scalability of your project and to understand the basics properly I'll suggest you to try this topic natively.

Regarding this repo I've used Kotlin as a main language which you all should also adapt to at this point because of it's features
and ease of use of multiple perks which helps us in coding. For creating section i've used the logic to create a nested recycler in
which the child recyclerview will display the main data. For populating the section i've tried to use the groupBy function of Kotlin 
which basically groups the Data in whichever form you want(certainly exciting isn't it).

If you found any issues or error with regard to this repo please fork me and share the details i'll be glad to hear your feedback.
